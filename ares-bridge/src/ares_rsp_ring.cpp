/*
 * ares_rsp_ring.cpp — always-on RSP per-instruction trace ring.
 *
 * Captures (PC, all 32 GPRs, DMA cop0 regs, SP_STATUS) every time
 * the Ares RSP core dispatches an instruction. The vendored Ares
 * core has a 4-line modification (extern "C" function pointer hook
 * declared in rsp.cpp; called at the top of RSP::instruction()) —
 * that pointer is set here at static-init time to point at our
 * `record_one_instruction` callback.
 *
 * Two storage tiers, mirroring the libultra-ring pattern from
 * lib/N64ModernRuntime/librecomp/include/librecomp/ultra_trace.hpp:
 *
 *   1. Sliding ring (16K events, ~2.5 MiB) — records every event,
 *      oldest evicts. Used for "what just happened" queries close
 *      to a hang or interesting moment.
 *
 *   2. Boot snapshot (32K events, ~5 MiB) — non-evicting; once the
 *      first 32K events are recorded, no more land here. Used for
 *      "what did the RSP do at startup" forensics.
 *
 * Total memory: ~7.5 MiB at process start, fixed thereafter. Cost
 * per recorded event: one branch (enabled check), GPR + DMA-reg
 * memcpy, atomic increment.
 *
 * Per the project rule "always-on ring buffer, never arm-then-capture":
 * the hook is installed unconditionally at process start and stays
 * recording until shutdown. Consumers QUERY a window of interest;
 * they don't ARM recording in advance.
