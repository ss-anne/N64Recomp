"""
Tier-1: tolerant-emit declarations and emit-site presence.

The tolerant-emit machinery (commits 512191b / ba044e3) is the engine's
ONLY acceptable fallback for instructions/branches the recompiler can't
translate at compile time. It must:

  (a) declare loud-abort runtime hooks in include/recomp.h
  (b) emit calls to those hooks from src/recompilation.cpp
  (c) keep (a) and (b) in lockstep — stale decls or unbacked emit
      sites are both bugs

All six hooks are load-bearing. There is no "store the bits in flat
storage and trust the game won't notice" fallback for any unmodeled
behavior, including unmodeled COP0 registers — that would be a stub
in violation of PRINCIPLES.md #12.

    The cop0 dispatch in recompilation.cpp must enumerate registers
